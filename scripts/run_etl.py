"""ETL orchestrator for the scheduled refresh job.

Runs each loader in-process and collects a structured LoaderReport (summary line
+ metrics), then emails a results summary via Azure Communication Services.
Running in-process (rather than as subprocesses) streams each loader's logs live
to the job log and lets the email render real metrics instead of grepping stdout.

The loaders are independent — the full NVD incremental writes nvd_vulnerabilities
and the KEV catalog writes kev_vulnerabilities — so every step runs regardless of
whether another fails, and their order doesn't matter.

Email is best-effort and optional: if the ACS_* / ETL_EMAIL_TO env vars are unset
(e.g. local runs), the email step is skipped. The process exit code reflects the
ETL outcome only — a failed email never masks a successful sync, and any failed
loader exits non-zero so the platform records the failure.

Env:
    ACS_ENDPOINT    Azure Communication Services endpoint (https://<host>)
    ACS_SENDER      Verified sender address (e.g. donotreply@<domain>.azurecomm.net)
    ETL_EMAIL_TO    Comma-separated recipient address(es)
    AZURE_CLIENT_ID Client ID of the user-assigned managed identity (for auth)
