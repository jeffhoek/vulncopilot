#
# Supabase serves every table in `public` over the PostgREST Data API, where requests
# arrive as the built-in `anon` / `authenticated` roles — and Supabase's own default
# privileges grant those roles ALL on tables created here. RLS is therefore the only
# thing standing between a leaked publishable key and full read/write on the corpus,
# and its absence is what Supabase's linter reports as `rls_disabled_in_public`.
#
# Enabling it is not consequence-free: RLS applies to every role except the table
# owner, so `app_readonly` and `app_etl` (docs/supabase-readonly-role.md) go from
# working to silently returning zero rows the instant it is switched on. The policies
# below restore exactly the access the GRANTs already describe. A policy filters rows,
# it never confers a privilege, so `USING (true)` for both roles leaves the read-only
# and no-DELETE posture of those roles fully intact.
#
# Split out from _TABLES_SQL so production can apply just this part with the admin
# role (see docs/supabase-rls.md), the same way view_ddl() is applied.
