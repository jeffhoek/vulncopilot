"""Composite risk score — the single source of truth for the blend.

Four prioritization signals already live in Postgres (CVSS severity, EPSS likelihood,
KEV confirmed exploitation, SSVC urgency), plus CWE weakness class as a minor
tiebreaker. This module owns the constants and *generates the SQL* from them, so the
arithmetic exists in exactly one place: `v_cve_risk` in Postgres.

Deliberately no second Python implementation of the same formula. A `risk_score`
Python function blending the same inputs would drift from the view the first time a
weight is edited, and nothing in CI would catch it because it would still pass its own
unit tests. Python's job here is the constants, the generated DDL, and the prose
(band names and the rationale string) — never the sum.

This module imports nothing from rag.database; the dependency runs the other way so
init_db() can apply the generated DDL.
