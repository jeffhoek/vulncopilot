# Data Loading

This guide covers populating the PostgreSQL/pgvector database with CISA KEV, NIST NVD, and MITRE CWE vulnerability data. These steps apply regardless of where the database is hosted (local container, Timescale Cloud, RDS, etc.).

## Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension enabled
- `.env` configured with `DATABASE_URL` (or `PG_*` vars) and `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Dependencies installed (`uv sync`)

### Connecting securely (keep the password out of `argv`)

The `psql` commands below use `"$DATABASE_URL"`. **Never embed the database password
in that variable** — anything on a command line is visible to every user on the host
via `ps`, and it lands in your shell history. Instead, export a **password-less**
connection string and let `~/.pgpass` supply the secret:

```bash
# password-less — safe to appear in ps / history
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>@<host>:5432/<db>"
```

```
# ~/.pgpass  (chmod 600)  —  host:port:db:user:password
<host>:5432:<db>:<user>:<password>
```

With a matching `~/.pgpass` entry, `psql "$DATABASE_URL"` authenticates with no
password on the command line. (The Python app reads its own credentialed
`DATABASE_URL`/`PG_DATABASE_URL` from `.env`, which is never passed on a command
line — this guidance is only for interactive `psql`.)

Verify pgvector is available:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT extname FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';"
```

If not present:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"
```

## Schema

Schema creation runs automatically on app startup. To create it manually:

```bash
uv run python -c "from rag.database import init_db; import asyncio; asyncio.run(init_db())"
```

## ETL Scripts

There are five ETL scripts, each targeting a different scope. To run the production
sequence rather than a single loader, see [Orchestrated run](#orchestrated-run-run_etlpy)
below.

| Script | Scope | Records | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scripts/load_kev.py` | CISA KEV catalog | ~1,500 | Always run first — KEV is the primary dataset |
| `scripts/load_nvd.py` | NVD data for KEV CVEs only | ~1,500 | Enriches KEV entries with CVSS scores, severity, affected products |
| `scripts/load_nvd_full.py` | Entire NVD database | ~280,000 | Full NVD corpus for broader vulnerability research |
| `scripts/load_cwe.py` | MITRE CWE definitions | ~900 | Resolves opaque CWE IDs to human-readable weakness names/descriptions |
| `scripts/load_epss.py` | FIRST.org EPSS daily scores | ~353,000 | Exploitation-likelihood signal for prioritization; leading indicator to KEV |

### Embedding batch sizing

Every loader routes embedding requests through `rag.embeddings.generate_embeddings_batch`,
which packs inputs against the API's 300k-tokens-per-request cap rather than a fixed item
count. Item count alone is not safe: 500 CVEs is ~96k tokens of ordinary advisory prose but
~305k when the window is dominated by Linux-kernel CVEs, whose stack traces and symbol names
tokenize about twice as densely.

Token counts are estimated from character length (a pessimistic 2 chars/token floor) rather
than measured with a tokenizer, because the k8s deployment currently runs behind a strict
egress allowlist that does not include tiktoken's BPE download host. That is a deployment
posture rather than a hard constraint — if the allowlist gains that host, exact `tiktoken`
counting drops straight into `estimate_tokens`. Either way, if the estimate is too low the
loader halves the batch on the API's "maximum request size" 400 and retries, so a bad
estimate costs an extra request instead of a failed run.

### 1. Load CISA KEV data

Fetches the CISA KEV catalog and generates OpenAI embeddings:

```bash
uv run python scripts/load_kev.py
```

### 2. Load NVD enrichment (KEV-scoped)

Fetches NVD data only for CVE IDs already in the `kev_vulnerabilities` table:

```bash
uv run python scripts/load_nvd.py
```

**Rate limits:**
- Without API key: 5 requests/30s (~5 min for full load)
- With API key: 50 requests/30s (~30 sec for full load)

The script is incremental — it skips CVEs already loaded, so re-runs only fetch new entries.

### 3. Load full NVD database (optional)

Fetches the entire NVD (~280k CVEs) via paginated bulk API calls. This is a large dataset requiring ~3.5-5.5 GB of storage (see [plans/postgres-hosting-options.md](../plans/postgres-hosting-options.md) for sizing details).

```bash
# Full load — fetches all CVEs, generates embeddings
uv run python scripts/load_nvd_full.py

# Incremental sync — fetches only CVEs published or modified since last run
uv run python scripts/load_nvd_full.py --incremental

# Override start date — use after an interrupted incremental run
uv run python scripts/load_nvd_full.py --incremental --since 2026-04-14

# Data only, skip embedding generation (faster initial load)
uv run python scripts/load_nvd_full.py --skip-embeddings

# Backfill embeddings for records loaded without them
uv run python scripts/load_nvd_full.py --backfill-embeddings

# Test with a limited number of pages
uv run python scripts/load_nvd_full.py --limit 3
```

**Features:**
- Paginated bulk fetching (2,000 CVEs per page)
- Checkpoint/resume — interrupted full loads pick up where they left off
- Two-phase incremental sync: new CVEs (by publish date) first, then modified CVEs — ensures newly published vulnerabilities aren't buried behind routine metadata updates
- Staging table upserts (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`) for idempotent loads
- Retry logic for both NVD API and database connections

**Recovering from an interrupted incremental sync:**

If you kill an incremental run mid-way, the `MAX(last_modified)` high-water mark in the DB will have advanced, causing the next run to skip unprocessed records. Use `--since` to force the original start date:

```bash
uv run python scripts/load_nvd_full.py --incremental --since 2026-04-14
```

Already-processed records will upsert harmlessly.

**Recommended workflow for the full NVD load:**

1. Load data without embeddings (fast, ~30 min with API key):
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/load_nvd_full.py --skip-embeddings
   ```

2. Backfill embeddings separately (can be interrupted and resumed):
   ```bash
   caffeinate -i uv run python scripts/load_nvd_full.py --backfill-embeddings
   ```

3. Keep up to date with incremental syncs (Phase 2 can take several hours — use `caffeinate -i`):
   ```bash
   caffeinate -i uv run python scripts/load_nvd_full.py --incremental
   ```

**HNSW index and large incremental syncs — drop before, rebuild after:**

NVD modifies thousands of CVEs per week for routine metadata refreshes (CVSS rescoring, CPE updates, etc.), so large incremental windows can involve tens of thousands of upserts (a catch-up after a long gap can touch the whole corpus). Maintaining the HNSW vector index on every batch causes significant Disk IO — per-row HNSW maintenance dominates the run, and on constrained hosting each 2,000-row batch can take several minutes.

**Dropping the index before a large bulk load and rebuilding it afterward is the single biggest lever — roughly a 5–10× speedup.** With `--skip-embeddings` the vectors don't change at all, so drop-then-rebuild reproduces an identical index and is lossless; even with embeddings, one clean rebuild is far cheaper than per-batch maintenance.

> **Baseline:** a full storm catch-up of `--incremental --since 2026-06-15 --skip-embeddings` synced **366,846 CVEs in 70m49s** on Supabase **Large (8 GB / 2-core)** with the HNSW index dropped.

**Bump Supabase compute (RAM, not cores) for the run, scale back down after.** The working set — a large HNSW index plus the heap — doesn't fit the small tiers, so more RAM means fewer IO cache-miss stalls; Large (8 GB) comfortably holds it. Cores don't help: Medium and Large are both 2-core and the ETL is a single stream, so the extra spend on cores buys nothing. Scale back down to your steady-state tier once the sync and rebuild finish.

> **Running this in the cloud instead of a laptop?** These same catch-ups (and the HNSW drop/rebuild + schedule-disable steps) are driven from Azure DevOps via the manual [ETL pipeline](etl-pipeline.md), which starts a long-timeout Container Apps Job — no `caffeinate`, no laptop.

```sql
-- 1. Before ETL (run in psql, or the Supabase SQL editor)
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS nvd_embedding_idx;
```

```bash
# 2. Run the sync with the index gone
caffeinate -i uv run python scripts/load_nvd_full.py --incremental
```

```bash
# 3. After ETL — rebuild in ONE session with 2GB maintenance_work_mem (usable on Large).
#    statement_timeout = 0 is mandatory: the Supabase SQL editor otherwise times out
#    and rolls back a long index build partway through. Prefer psql for this reason.
caffeinate -i time psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SET statement_timeout = 0; SET maintenance_work_mem = '2GB'; CREATE INDEX nvd_embedding_idx ON nvd_vulnerabilities USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);"
```

```bash
# 4. Refresh planner statistics so the new index is actually used
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "ANALYZE nvd_vulnerabilities;"
```

Monitor rebuild progress in the Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
SELECT phase, tuples_done, tuples_total,
       round(tuples_done::numeric / nullif(tuples_total, 0) * 100, 1) AS pct_done
FROM pg_stat_progress_create_index
WHERE relid = 'nvd_vulnerabilities'::regclass;
```

The row disappears when the build completes. Expect roughly an hour for ~366k rows at 1536 dimensions; the chatbot's semantic search is unavailable during the rebuild window but the app remains up.

For smaller weekly syncs the index overhead is usually tolerable — skip the drop/rebuild unless upsert batches start taking several minutes.

### 4. Load CWE definitions (optional)

Resolves the CWE IDs stored in the `cwes` column of the KEV and NVD tables to human-readable weakness names and descriptions. Downloads MITRE's CWE list and upserts it into `cwe_definitions`:

```bash
uv run python scripts/load_cwe.py
```

No API key or authentication required. The script is idempotent — re-running pulls the latest CWE release (published 2–3 times per year) and upserts any changes. See [cwe-integration.md](cwe-integration.md) for schema and example join queries.

### 5. Load EPSS scores (optional)

Loads FIRST.org's daily exploitation-likelihood scores into `epss_scores`, giving each CVE a probability of being exploited within 30 days plus a percentile rank:

```bash
uv run python scripts/load_epss.py
```

No API key required, and fast — ~353k rows in a couple of seconds via a bulk staging upsert. The feed refreshes daily, so this is worth running on the same schedule as KEV. Re-running within the same publication is idempotent. See [epss-integration.md](epss-integration.md) for schema, the redirect/format gotchas, and prioritization query examples.

## Orchestrated run (`run_etl.py`)

The individual loaders above are for one-off and first-time loads. The recurring
refresh runs them together through a single orchestrator:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_etl.py
```

This is the production entrypoint — the scheduled Azure Container Apps job runs the same
script (as `/app/.venv/bin/python scripts/run_etl.py`), so this is the way to reproduce a
production run locally. See
[Operating the job](deploy-azure-app-service.md#operating-the-job) to trigger it in
Azure, watch an execution, or read past logs.

It runs three steps, in this order:

| Step | Entrypoint | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| NVD full incremental | `scripts/load_nvd_full.py:run_incremental` | `nvd_vulnerabilities` |
| KEV catalog | `scripts/load_kev.py:run` | `kev_vulnerabilities` |
| EPSS scores | `scripts/load_epss.py:run` | `epss_scores` |

Notes on behavior:

- **Every step always runs.** The three loaders write different tables and are
  independent, so a failure in one does not skip the others — the run reports each
  outcome separately. Order is therefore not significant; NVD is first only because it
  is the long pole. This is why the SSVC failure in the NVD step left KEV and EPSS
  passing.
- **The NVD step is incremental**, not a full load. It derives its start date from
  `MAX(last_modified)` / `MAX(published)` in `nvd_vulnerabilities`, so a full load must
  have happened first — see [Load full NVD database](#3-load-full-nvd-database-optional).
  It takes no arguments here; for `--since` catch-ups, run the loader directly.
- **Exit code** is 0 only if every step succeeded, 1 otherwise.
- **Email is optional and best-effort.** If `ACS_ENDPOINT`, `ACS_SENDER` and
  `ETL_EMAIL_TO` are all set, a summary is sent via Azure Communication Services;
  otherwise the step logs `Email not configured — skipping`, which is normal locally.
  A failed send never changes the exit code.
- **Each run is recorded to the `etl_runs` table** (status, elapsed, per-step JSON
  results). This is also best-effort — a DB write failure is logged and swallowed so it
  cannot mask the ETL outcome. Query it to review run history:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "SELECT id, run_at, status, total_elapsed FROM etl_runs ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

## NVD API Key

All NVD scripts benefit from an API key, which increases the rate limit from 5 to 50 requests per 30 seconds. Set `NVD_API_KEY` in `.env`. Request a free key at https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key.

## Verification

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM kev_vulnerabilities;"
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nvd_vulnerabilities;"
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nvd_vulnerabilities WHERE embedding IS NULL;"
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cwe_definitions;"
```

## Refreshing Data

**CISA KEV + NVD enrichment** (re-run to pick up new entries):

```bash
uv run python scripts/load_kev.py
uv run python scripts/load_nvd.py
```

**Full NVD** (incremental sync):

```bash
# Weekly — index overhead is usually fine
caffeinate -i uv run python scripts/load_nvd_full.py --incremental

# Monthly / large gap — bump to Large compute (RAM, not cores), drop HNSW index first, rebuild after (see above)
```

No app restart is needed — data is queried live from the database.
